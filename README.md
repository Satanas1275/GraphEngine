# CasioGraph-3D-game-engine

**CasioGraph-3D-game-engine** is my first 3D game engine designed for the **CASIO Graph 35+E II** calculator.  
It aims to bring real-time 3D rendering, movement, and game logic to a device with extremely limited hardware — pushing the calculator to its limits.

This project includes:
- A custom 3D renderer
- Player movement and physics experimentation
- A clock system for continuous world updates
- Ongoing improvements such as collision, UI elements, and more

This engine is still in development, but it already demonstrates what's possible on CASIO calculators with efficient C and gint programming.
